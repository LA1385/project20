        <h1 style="text-align: center;">MULTIPLICATOR CALCULATOR</h1>
        <p>In this project I am showing how fuction works under javascript. Since we know that java is also a programming language needed for the creation of a responsive webpage or websites. So here we are creating a multiplicator calculator using javascript. Well in this you just need to pay attention to my code, then afterward we would be developing it bit by bit.</p>
        <script>
            function f5(a,b,c)
            { var w2=a*b*c;
                document.write(w2+"<br>");
            }
            f5(50.7,75.4,66.05)//all this are called argument.

            function f5(h, i, j) {
                    var t2 = h * i * j;
                    document.write(t2 + "<br>");
                }
                f5(57, 45, 23)//all this are called argument.
            //This is called scope of variables
                 function f6(x,y,z){
                    var r1=x*y*z;
                    return r1;
                 }
                 document.write(f6(4,3,5)+"<br>");   

               function f7(x, y, z) {
                    var y1 = x * y * z;
                    return y1;
                }
                document.write(f7(50, 67, 98) + "<br>");
